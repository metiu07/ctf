This page isn't a tutorial, just a random collection of commands and things to remember about docker.
Docker is really useful when working with complex tools that need to be built.
For example, I always encountered problems getting *angr* to work. Now it's just starting the container.

# Overview

TL;DR: Docker is used to run containers. :)

# Terms

`Container image` is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
Basically, the image is a snapshot of the operating system and everything that is always used as a base for new containers.

`Container` is an instance of the image that was run or is still running.

# Mac

Since docker can't use Mac's kernel to run containers.
You need to set up a virtual machine for this purpose.
It relatively simple to install with `docker-machine`.

```
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox dev # create a VM
```

In order to use docker, the correct environment variables need to be set.

```
eval $(docker-machine env dev)                # set up environment variables for docker to use
```

More detailed [docs](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/).

## docker-machine RAM

There are some options worth mentioning while creating the VM.

```
docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 4096 <VM_NAME>
```

# Status commands

These commands are for checking what is installed/running on your machine.

```
docker ps         # list running containers
docker ps -a      # list *all* containers
docker images     # list installed images
docker-machine ls # list installed docker machines
```

# Running containers

This is the **main command**. Containers are created and started with `docker run`.
This means that they live until the root process exists.
After the root process exists container is stopped and saved ( it's easier to debug what happened to container this way).
If you don't need container after the job is finished, use `--rm` option to remove it after execution ends.

```
docker run -it angr/angr # Start container from angr/angr image
# -i               : Keep STDIN open even if not attached
# -t               : Allocate a pseudo-tty
# --rm=false       : Automatically remove the container when it exits
# -p=[host]:[guest]: Publish a containerá¾¿s port or a range of ports to the host
# -P               : Publish all exposed ports to the host interfaces
# -v [host-src:]container-dest[:<options>]: Bind mount a volume. (Simply share a folder)
# -d               : Start container in detached mode
```

# Editing images

Sometimes you have to edit an image just a little so you don't have to do the same thing over and over when you start your container.
This can be done in a few simple steps.

```
# start a container image with shell
docker run -it angr/angr

# make desired changes to the container
# angr is missing sudo
docker exec -ti -u root angr bash
# do some stuff

# find the container id of the edited container
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
182872859a65        angr/angr           "/bin/sh -c 'su - ang"   57 seconds ago      Exited (0) 54 seconds ago                       competent_blackwell

# commit changes to the new image
docker commit 182872859a65 <NEW_IMAGE_NAME>
```

# Useful containers

Containers I use/used in some point of time.

```
sudo docker pull angr/angr
sudo docker pull strm/metasploit
sudo docker pull owncloud
sudo docker pull wordpress
sudo docker pull busybox
# RETDEC docker image
```
