This is a challenge from *WhiteHat Grand Prix 2018 â€“ Quals*.
I wasn't able to find any writeups for this challenge, but I will at least write about what I know about it.

**DISCLAIMER: NOT FINISHED**

# Where to start

We were given a IP + file.
Since I trust myself more in forensics, I started with file.

```sh
vagrant@archlinux:[re07-500]$ file 0955bfcf85d870fe7217d8b6cb2ae576.bin
0955bfcf85d870fe7217d8b6cb2ae576.bin: data
```

It's just data... Luckily `binwalk` found something inside.

```sh
vagrant@archlinux:[re07-500]$ binwalk 0955bfcf85d870fe7217d8b6cb2ae576.bin

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

```

Most interesting thing about this file was **Squashfs** filesystem.
I ran `binwalk` extraction and started looking at internet for documentation.
But when I looked back to terminal, `binwalk` was able to extract everything in the meantime.
So there was no need for mounting the filesystem...

```sh
vagrant@archlinux:[re07-500]$ binwalkbinwalk -eM 0955bfcf85d870fe7217d8b6cb2ae576.bin
# ...
```

## What should I even look for?

There was nothing particularly interesting about the extracted files.
I spend a few minutes randomly reading files and trying to figure out what is relevant.

I found Nothing...

## Recon

Now was the time to look at the given IP(45.77.30.7).

It's XAMPP dashboard, and since I did web stuff a long time ago. I had no clue where to begin.
So I took a break. And then it **struck me**.

Let's check what `nmap` has to say.

```sh
vagrant@archlinux:[_restart.htm.extracted]$ nmap 45.77.30.7
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-08-18 14:55 UTC
Nmap scan report for 45.77.30.7.vultr.com (45.77.30.7)
Host is up (0.30s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
80/tcp    open  http
6969/tcp  open  acmsoda
10010/tcp open  rxapi

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 54.57 seconds
```

Port 6969 was very suspicious. But I didn't want to underestimate others, so I played with all of them.

```sh
vagrant@archlinux:[_restart.htm.extracted]$ nc 45.77.30.7 6969
~\m/~
Pr00f-of-H4rdW0rk
Door is available.
123
Hey commander! I don't understand S/m\S
help
Hey commander! I don't understand S/m\S
```

Finally, something to work with. 6969 was really promising.

Now I grepped for the string and voila, we have a binary.

```sh
vagrant@archlinux:[_0955bfcf85d870fe7217d8b6cb2ae576.bin-1.extracted]$ grep -ra "Door is" .
./shella:%sDoor is unavailable.
./shella:[XXX] Secured Door is %s
./shella: setgetDoor is available.
./_shella.extracted/0.elf:%sDoor is unavailable.
./_shella.extracted/0.elf:[XXX] Secured Door is %s
./_shella.extracted/0.elf: setgetDoor is available.
```

# Analysis

Let's be honest. I ran the `file` command on binary and totally disregarded the information **it was actutally MIPS**.
Opened hopper. Looking few seconds at the weird x86... Opened radare to cross-check if I see right. It was even worse.

My half asleep brain took a while to realize it was actually different architecture.

I used r2 to disassemble the binary and this is what I got so far. Really abstract overview of what is happening.
Without encryption routines. If there is anyone who wants to help and collaborate, I will be really glad.

```c
void main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    for(;;) {
    	 // listen on the port
	 // fork
	 // thread_func(client_fd)
    } 
    return 0;
}
```

Binary does some shanenigans with random. But I supose this will be mostly defeated by fork.
Everytime new connection is established `thread_func` will be run.

```c
void thread_func(client_fd) { // created by fork
    uint32_t enc_key[4] = {0};
    write(constant, len(constant), client_fd);
    if(checkFlag()) {
	// string = Door is available.\n
    } else {
	// string = Door is unavailable.\n
    }

    write(string, strlen(string), client_fd);
    memset(message_for_user, 0, 200);

    while(true) {
	read_size = read(user_message, 200, client_fd);

	if(read_size > 0) {
	    if(processMessage(&user_message, &enc_key) == 0) {
		message_for_user = "Hey_Commander I dont understand your message"; //...
	    }
	    write(message_for_user, strlen(message_for_user), socket);
	    memset(message_for_user, 0, 200);
	} else {
	    if(read_size != 0) {
		// close and print something prob irelevant
	    }
	    return;
	}
    }
}
```

Function `processMessage` will parse the message from net and call corresponding function. Either `get` or `set` flag.

```c
int processMessage(char ** user_message, uint32_t * something) {
    int ret = 1;
    message_dup = strdup(user_message)
    token = strtok(message_dup, "some delim?");

    if(strcmp(token, "set") != 0) {
	if(strcmp(token, "get") != 0) {
	    getFlag(something, &user_messsage);
	    ret = 0;
	}
    } else {
	first_token = strtok(NULL, "prob space");
	second_token = strtok(NULL, "prob space");
	if(first_token != NULL && second_token != NULL) {
	    ret = 0;
	    setFlag(second_token, first_token, &user_message);
	}
    }
    free(message_dup);
    return ret;
}
```

This part is responsible for setting the flag.
Function `checkpass` will check the received password with a stored md5 digest.
But since I wasn't wasn't able yet to break md5 hash, it's maybe not intended to even be called aside from organizators.

```c
char* setFlag(char * received_flag, char * received_pass, char ** result_message) {
    int result = 0;
    if (checkpass(received_pass, global_expected_pass) == 0) {
        result_message = "Are you r341";
    } else {
        if (writeFlag(global_bool?, received_pass) == 0) {
	    result_message = "Set door failed";
        } else {
	   sprintf(result_message, "Door setted to %s\n", obj.flag);
        }
	printf(result_message);
    }
    return result;
}

int32_t?/uint8_t checkpass(char * my_pass, char * expected_pass) {
    size_t pass_len = strlen(my_pass);
    MD5_CTX md5_struct = 0;
    MD5Init(&md5_struct);
    MD5Update(&md5_struct, my_pass, pass_len);
    MD5Final(&md5_struct);
    // "d\x17\x93edn\x8b\x8a\xba*g\x92fD\xa83\x01" -> len = 17
    // "d\x17\x93edn\x8b\x8a\xba*g\x92fD\xa83" last byte is wrong?
    // 64179365646e8b8aba2a67926644a833 -> hexdigest
    if(strncmp(md5_struct->digest?, expected_pass, 0x10 /* 16 */) < 1) {
    	return 1;
    } else {
      	return 0; 
    }
}

int32_t writeFlag(int32_t a1, int32_t a2) {
    int32_t result;
    if ((flag_file = fopen("flag", "wb")) != 0) {
        fwrite(obj.flag, 1, 0x3d /* 61 */, flag_file);
	fclose(flag_file);
        result = 1;
    } else {
        result = 0;
    }
    return result;
}
```

Get flag part is a little more complicated.

```c
char * getFlag(uint32_t * enc_key, char * user_message) {
    char * result;
    if(checkFlag() != 0) {
	flag? = clean(enc_key);
	sprintf(user_message, "[XXX] Secured Door is %s\n", flag?);
	free(flag?);
    } else {
	result = "Door is unavailable.\n";
    }
    return result;
}

char * clean(uint32_t * enc_key) {
    flag_copy = malloc(65);
    srand(time(NULL));
    strcpy(flag_copy, obj.flag);

    uint32_t r = rand();

    int counter = 0;

    size_t flag_len = strlen(obj.flag);

    uint32_t r1 = rand();
    enc_key[0] = r1;
    enc_key[1] = r1;
    enc_key[2] = r1;
    enc_key[3] = r1;

    size_t new_flag_len = flag_len + 3;
    if(new_flag_len >= 0) {
	new_flag_len += 3;
    }
    new_flag_len /= 4;

    // Only the first 1/4 of the flag is encoded with btea
    btea(&flag_copy, new_flag_len & 0xff, enc_key);

    // Rest is encoded with regular xor
    for(int counter = 0; counter < new_flag_len * 4; counter++) {
	if(flag_copy[counter]) {
	    flag_copy[counter] = flag_copy[counter] ^ r;
	}
    }
    flag_copy[new_flag_len * 4] = '\0';
    return flag_copy;
}
```

This function looks like a [block TEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm?oldformat=true) encryption.
Although it's probably more matching [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXTEA?oldformat=true#Reference_code) algorithm.

```
void btea(char * flag_copy, byte num, something_arr) {
    0x30 = flag_copy;
    0x38 = something_arr;
    0x34 = num;
    // flag_copy[(num + 0x3fffffff) * 2]
    // ...
}

loadFlag() {
    fread(obj.flag, 1, 61, 'flag');
    fclose('flag');
}

int checkFlag(char *flag?) {
    loadFlag();

    if(obj.flag != null) {
	return 1;
    } else {
	return 0;
    }
}
```
