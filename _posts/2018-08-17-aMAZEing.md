# aMAZEing - Hackcon18 - prog

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to solve this challenge during the competition.
But since it was really interesting I am going to analyze it a bit further.

> Thanks to my AI course at uni.

## First look

After connecting to given service, we receive the welcome message, that tells to expect variable size
maze image and we must find the path from (0, 0) to (n, n). 
The program will send you a .png image. First goals are to extract the image and save it.

```
Get ready to solve some mazes.
We will send you a image over this socket. Give us the path which is required to go from position (0,0) in the top left to position (n, n) in the bottom right.
If no such path is possible please send back 'INVALID' without any quotes.

The path should be given in terms of WASD alphabets. Where they represent the folling:
         W = Move up
         A = Move left
         S = Move down
         D = Move right

Ready to recieve (Press Enter)
```

## Extracting image from web service

To communicate with the server I used pwntools and just saved the image to file.
My first attempt wasn't correct, but I used hexdump to figure out that the problem was excess bytes at the file header.

```python
from pwn import *
from PIL import Image

r = remote('139.59.30.165', 9300)

r.recvuntil('(Press Enter)\n\n')
r.sendline()

image = r.recvuntil('Give ') # 'us the path or write INVALID')
image_file = open('image_file.png', 'wb')
image_file.write(image)
image_file.close()
```

This is a random image of a maze.

## Solving the aMAZE

There are many approaches to this problem.
My initial guess was to use A*, but since the BFS is simpler let's do that first. It was a good exercise.

Let's try it on a smaller sample so its easier to debug and spot problems. This should be fine.

![Small MAZE]({{ "/assets/aMAZEing1.png" | absolute_url}})

Before we start, we should "divide image by 10" because each block of the maze is represented by 10x10 pixels of the same colour.

```python
im = Image.open('image_file.png', 'r')
width, height = im.size
width //= 10
height //= 10

# Maze blocks are in 10x10 grid
maze = [[im.getpixel((x*10, y*10)) for y in range(height)] for x in range(width)]

res = bfs((0, 0), (width - 1, height - 1), maze)
```

### BFS

[Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search?oldformat=true) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

```python
direction = {( 0,  1): 'W',
             ( 1,  0): 'A',
             ( 0, -1): 'S',
             (-1,  0): 'D'}

def is_valid(node):
    x, y = node
    return 0 <= x < width and 0 <= y < height and all(c == 255 for c in maze[x][y])

def expand(node):
    return list(filter(is_valid, [tuple(map(operator.add, node, coef)) for coef in direction.keys()]))

def bfs(start, end, maze):
    iteration = 0

    OPEN = []
    CLOSED = []
    FROM = {start: None}

    OPEN.insert(0, start)

    while OPEN:
        iteration += 1

        if iteration % image_freq == 0 and result_animation:
            save_image(OPEN, CLOSED)

        cur_node = OPEN.pop(0);

        if cur_node == end:
            result = []
            while cur_node is not None:
                result.append(cur_node)
                cur_node = FROM[cur_node]
            return list(reversed(result))

        for node in expand(cur_node):
            if node not in OPEN and node not in CLOSED:
                OPEN.insert(0, node)
                FROM[node] = cur_node
        CLOSED.append(cur_node)
```

With some additional code, we can nicely visualize the exploring of the state space.

And the final path is.

![Small MAZE result]({{ "/assets/aMAZEing4.png" | absolute_url}})

Finally, convert the path to the series of 'WASD' commands and send them back to the server.

```python
direction = {( 0,  1): 'W',
             ( 1,  0): 'A',
             ( 0, -1): 'S',
             (-1,  0): 'D'}

def path_to_wasd(path):
    if not path:
        return 'INVALID'
        
    wasd = []
    for first, second in zip(path, path[1:]):
        wasd.append(direction[tuple(map(operator.sub, first, second))])
    return ''.join(wasd)
```

Now its just a matter of pwntools `sendline(path_to_wasd(res))`.

### A*

[A\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm?oldformat=true) is a lot like BFS but uses information (which sometimes could speed up the calculation).

Wiki provides some nice [psuedo code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/A*_search_algorithm#/Pseudocode) for us to check out.

Before I finished A*, I packed everything into class MazeSolver so that it was a little simpler to use.

```python
def manhattan(node1, node2):
    x1, y1 = node1
    x2, y2 = node2
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)

def astar(self, start, end, maze, heuristic = manhattan):
    self.solve_method = MazeSolver.ASTAR_METHOD_NAME
    iteration = 0

    OPEN = dict()
    OPEN[start] = 0 + heuristic(start, end)

    CLOSED = set()

    G_FUNC = dict()
    G_FUNC[start] = 0

    FROM = {start: None}

    while OPEN:

    iteration += 1

    if iteration % self.image_freq == 0 and self.result_animation:
        self.save_solving_snapshot(OPEN, G_FUNC.keys())

    # Get the best rated node
    cur_node = min(OPEN, key=OPEN.get)

    if cur_node == end:
        result = []
        while cur_node is not None:
        result.append(cur_node)
        cur_node = FROM[cur_node]
        if self.result_image:
        self.save_result(result)
        print(iteration)
        return list(reversed(result))

    CLOSED.add(cur_node)

    # f(s) = g(s) + h(s)
    # g(s) = cost of getting to node
    # h(s) = estimate of path to end
    for node in self.expand(cur_node):
        if node not in OPEN and node not in CLOSED:
        tmp_node_rating = G_FUNC.get(cur_node) + 1 + heuristic(node, end) 
        if tmp_node_rating >= OPEN.get(node, float('inf')):
            continue
        OPEN[node] = tmp_node_rating
        G_FUNC[node] = G_FUNC[cur_node] + 1
        FROM[node] = cur_node

    del OPEN[cur_node]
    return []
```

A* is a probably a bit overkill for this kind of challenge. In my measurements, A* **was** sometimes slower than BFS. Prob my implementation sucks.

Either way, I had fun solving mazes, and view this challenge as a valuable lesson.
