Definition from the wiki.
> Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments,[4] e.g. for VirtualBox, Hyper-V, Docker containers, VMware, and AWS which try to simplify software configuration management of virtualizations in order to increase development productivity.

{% include toc %}

Basically, I use vagrant to manage most of my virtual machines.
No one wants to run untrusted code on own OS and vagrant makes it super easy.
But whenever something fishy happens, you can just destroy your VM and in another second 
have another clean instance up and running.

Vagrant provides free [boxes](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search) (which is a fancy word for user premade VMs with preinstalled distros and programs).
You can further customize those VMs and include your favourite tools and resources with shared folders, set up scripts, provisioning, etc.

## Quickstart

Firstly you need to download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
After this, you will have access to vagrant commands. Syntax is as follows `vagrant <command>`.

To start, create an empty directory for VM configuration files and let's set up the box.

```sh
mkdir ~/vagrant
cd ~/vagrant
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64 # create configuration file -> Vagrantfile
                             # and download the box
vagrant up                   # start the VM
```

This will take a little while. Vagrant will download necessary files, prepare the VM and start it.
After this step is done, VM is running you can connect to it via ssh.

```sh
vagrant ssh
```

Next time you want to work just skip the init part. Start the machine with `vagrant up` and connect to it with `vagrant ssh`.

## Safe space

Don't worry about breaking anything. I know how much you want to try those.

```sh
sudo rm -rf # or one with preserve root
:(){ :|:& };:
sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/libc*
```

Now to restore the VM use command `vagrant destroy`. However be careful, this will reset your VM data.

## Box config

Every box can be configured in its corresponding Vagrantfile. Just create a folder for each VM and have the Vagrantfile there.

For example:
```
vagrant
├── school
│   └── Vagrantfile
├── devel
│   └── Vagrantfile
└── ubuntu
    ├── README.md
    ├── Vagrantfile
    └── vagrant_set up.sh
```

### GUI

This is all nice but you only get to run your VM in "headless" mode by default.
There are people who prefer CLI, but you can get VM to start with GUI by configuring your vagrant file.

This is the code sample for virtual box, other providers might have different options.
```
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
   vb.gui = true
end
```

### Forwarding ports

Sometimes I use vagrant for hosting various stuff, even this jekyll blog for testing.
To access those services from the host you need to set up the port forwarding in Vagrantfile.

```sh
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 29160, host: 29160
```

Now you can access the service via `localhost:29160`.

### X11 forwarding

I find this feature particularly helpful.
You can run a program(window) in VM and display it on your host.
Some set up is needed, tho. But nothing that hard.

### Shared folders

By default, the folder containing your Vagrantfile is linked to `/vagrant` in the guest machine.
This is the simple default way. But you can set up the files however you like.

```sh
config.vm.synced_folder "~/folder_on_host_machine", "/home/vagrant/folder_in_your_vm"
```

### RAM

Low ram can cause a lot of unexpected problems that are hard to debug. **\*cough\*** `bundle install` **\*cough\***. 
1 to 2 GB should be enough. Just adjust the Vagrantfile:

```
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "1024"
end
```

## Creating your own boxes

Under construction.
